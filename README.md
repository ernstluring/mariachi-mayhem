# mariachi-mayhem
Mariachi Mayhem is a fun party game created in 48 hours during the Global Game Jam 2016 with as theme “ritual”. The game was created with a team of 4 people: two 3d artists, one animator and me as programmer.

The goal of the game is to get as much skeletons as possible on the altar in the middle of the screen. To win you can bash your opponents away, steal the skeleton and stay in the lead.
